The main driver file of our project is the readfile.py file.

To run, simply make sure that the path in the run() method is the correct one and start running the readfile.py.
The path is defaulted to "input_files/50_board_inputs.txt" and can be changed whenever.

The puzzles will be parsed and will run all of them sequentially.
